# Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 25, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how the Moalimee mobile application (the “App”) collects, uses, shares, and protects the personal information of users. By using the App you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

1. Information We Collect
- Account information: name, email address, profile data you provide when you register or sign in.
- Authentication data: tokens or credentials needed for account access (securely stored).
- Service usage: anonymous and aggregated usage metrics and analytics to help us improve the App.
- Device & diagnostics: device model, OS version, crash logs and performance data.
- Content and activity: lessons accessed, progress, answers you submit, and preferences.

2. How We Use Information
- Provide and operate the App, authenticate users, and maintain your account.
- Personalize the experience, save preferences, and track lesson progress.
- Diagnose and fix issues, monitor performance, and improve features.
- Communicate with you about updates, support, and safety/security notifications.

3. Third-Party Services
The App may use third-party services to provide functionality (for example, YouTube playback, analytics, or hosting). These third parties may collect information according to their own privacy policies. Examples include:
- YouTube (for video playback)
- Analytics and crash reporting providers

You should review the privacy policies of those services. We do not control third-party policies.

4. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell personal information. We may share data with service providers that perform services for us (hosting, analytics) and where required by law. Shared data is limited to what is necessary to provide those services.

5. Data Retention
We retain personal data only as long as necessary to provide the App and comply with legal obligations. If you delete your account (where applicable), your personal data will be removed or anonymized within a reasonable time period, except where retention is required by law.

6. Security
We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is completely secure.

7. Children
The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such data, please contact us and we will take steps to remove it.

8. Your Rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data, and to object to certain processing. To exercise these rights, contact us at the address below.

9. International Transfers
Data may be stored or processed in countries other than your country of residence. By using the App you consent to the transfer of information to countries that may have different data protection laws.
